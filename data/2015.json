My application takes two very specific problems and fixes them with the click of a button. Not only that, but my application makes solving other problems much easier by providing the user with system shortcuts that lead to various parts of the Windows operating system that control many different aspects of the computer. This application is a \"one-stop-shop\" if you will for a Network Administrator.",

Many people like cats because they don't need constant attention and they pretty much take care of themselves. Cats don't have to be walked but that means dealing with cat waste inside of the home. This includes biological waste as well as cat litter itself. Cat litter toxicity has been a hot topic for a while now. \"In 1997, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified silica as a human carcinogen yet it is estimated that roughly 95 percent of U.S. cat litter is a form of silica\" (Grillo). To keep the air in your house as fresh and healthy as possible I designed an improved automated cat litter box ventilation system. The clear air uses a computer controlled exhaust fan to ventilate a litter box after each use sending the bad smells out of a house or apartment. The system also keeps tabs on how many times the litter box has been used and sends a friendly text message reminder to change the litter.",

Since the business owner did not have time to set up a website and all the additional components himself, I chose to take this project on as my capstone project. I tackled this project by first creating a plan and deciding on a timeline, figuring out what tools I wanted to use, and researching to find good references for learning how to build the website I wanted to create. Although this project is still a 'work in progress', I am very pleased to have been able to learn a number of new and useful skills over the course of this semester and help a small business owner gain a platform from which he can reach the world.",

An alternative to OEM systems are aftermarket radios. You can get these radios with many of the same features; without the vehicle diagnostics. Aftermarket units won't have the ability to be upgraded without replacing the whole unit. My solution for this is to build a car computer. A car computer is a computer that mounts somewhere hidden in the car and is controlled via a touchscreen in place of the radio. It adds features through software and peripherals. It can have all of the abilities of an OEM infotainment system and will be upgradable due to its modularity.",

In this project I will discuss and show the procedures for building your own animatronic Halloween prop, using a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). Building your own animated props for Halloween requires careful planning and design, but with a little time spent at the beginning of the process, the builder can make their own animatronic props at a fraction of the cost that they would spend if they purchased them from a store. Utilizing PLC's, a builder can combine different motors to create various movements and sequence them to the desired effect. For example having the PLC control a smoke machine, then a motor to lift a coffin lid, activate lights and work other types of actuators to extend and retract a hand. Simple wiring techniques make it possible to connect the different components to the controller, making building your own Halloween decorations easy. The only limit to the projects are your imagination.",

I achieved this goal by implementing these components, Raspberry Pi 2, a home/local network with internet access, Raspbian (Debian lite), OpenVPN with Easy RSA, and other peripherals such as cables, keyboard etc. I prepared the Raspberry Pi 2 with Raspbian, configured my home network, configured the Pi for SSH access, and installed and configured OpenVPN and Easy RSA. I performed commands that would generate certificates and keys for the server and the client, or the device to be using the server. Once this was completed, I generated OpenVPN profiles that contained the client keys and server certificate along with the server information. Finally, I transferred the profile to the device with the installed client OpenVPN application and successfully connected the Pijacker Preventer.",

Often this training fails to come before attackers have changed their tactics. Individuals seeking a degree to become a part of the professional field of security are required to complete a four-year broad curriculum that can often be outdated in core areas upon completion. Malicious hackers do not suffer these constraints and gain their skills in unconventional ways. Many individuals who seek to become productive members of society are not afforded endless hours to delve into code and self-taught ethical hacking. Nor is there a broad highway for those individuals to learn upon without risking being misinterpreted and falling victim to some loosely worded legalities. I suggest to have updated network security skills, individuals build an environment in which they have authorization to do so.

You are likely to see an individual wearing an activity tracker, such as the Fitbit or Jawbone Up, as you are likely to see someone with a smartphone. Smart devices and activity trackers are integrated together to provide the user with their health records along with other features. With this is mind I wanted to incorporate the popular aspects of the activity tracker into a small wearable device that could be used for household pets, mainly dogs. In addition to providing activity tracking features like a pedometer I wanted a device that would locate the animal through GPS encase they were missing. If you have ever lost a pet you know how devastating the experience can be. Pets are family members, and we must do everything within our power to keep them safe. The WatchDog helps accomplish this mission by utilizing micro Arduino boards called Xadow manufactured by Seeed Studio. The Xadow boards are not the only unique features added to the WatchDog collar. As you read about the product you will find detailed information in every aspect of the project for the design. From high visibility features at night to displaying alerts for medication doses have been incorporated into the WatchDog. The Watchdog will change how we interact with our pets' lives forever.",

This will also give the user a strong alternative to third party cloud service tools such as Drop Box, One Drive, and iCloud by giving the user complete control over their cloud storage. The implementation of this project will utilizing a Raspberry Pi 2 microcomputer with a micro SD card, an external hard drive, a Wi-Fi USB Adapter, a modem or router, a USB hub, a NOOBs OS img, and the ownCloud software. The implementation of this project will be broken down into several phases including: disk formatting, OS and server software installation, setting up ownCloud, and testing the system.",
