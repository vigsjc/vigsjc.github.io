        "projectDesc": "First, how in the world would a person come up with project like this? Well, when a person that world a lot and has a new house dog that isn't used to spending a long time away from its owner. There are a lot of bookst that state that when a puppy is away from its owner they eat and find things to chew on or find threates taht they have hidden form times that they are alone. One thing came to my mind and that is an all-in-one dog care system that feeds, provides water and gives treats. We all know that they are automatic water and feed dispensers. But no where was there a treat dispenser. So I took all three ideas and combined them into one big glass case box. All that was left was to decide how to do all three things into one and keep it cheap. One thing comes to mind is 'Ebay'. I figured that is way I can keep it cheap. That takes care only thwo things - the feeder, water bowls and a PLC. Yes, a PLC, it will control up to 8 outputs and accepts 16 inputs. This controller allows me to have inputs for manually operated controls and give some awesome sensors for automated control features.",

One way of achieving this is through a Master-Slave PLC configuration. What the Master/Slave configuration is, it’s a setting that you the programmer set up. Such a configuration could be useful in an assembly line which requires both local controls for the worker set as the slave and another set of controls for overriding the local control if needed, those set by the master. A master PLC can sequence the operations of several PLCs using this type of configuration. In the project it has been used for initiating the lockdown of a prison in the event of an escape attempt.",

It also supports Cyrillic characters in every part of the system possible, including important programs for everyday users like office programs and chat programs. This distribution is a bootable iso as well as installable. The goal of this distribution is to bring an easy to use Linux to Russian speaking people. This distribution is Debian based for apt-get/synaptic support. This distribution attempts to solve the lack of simpliclty for typing Cyrillic characters easily in linux by creating a downloadable/cd-bootable Russian debian based distribution.

The robot was motivated by the DARPA Grand Challenge, on a much smaller level and constructed around the premise of the NAIT competition and the newly added autonomous section of the competition. The robot isn't ready to compete just yet, but the understanding of its controls may lead to better controls for use on the actual NAIT robot. Following the specifications for the NAIT competition, which states that the robot must be able to follow an inch and a half wide piece of aluminium tape I came up with the simplest possible solution. Even so the project provided plenty of problems for me to deal with as any project will. The tape, specified in the NAIT outline is conductive making the soution much less complex than expected. The solution was to create a set of parallel circuits which used this property. The project did finally come together and the robot followed the path of the tape quite well, even though there were several glitches that had to be worked out.",

This has always been something that I have been interested in ever since our house was broken into when I was 13. We had just recently moved into a new home and within a few weeks of living there our house was broken into, luckily we had a security system. However, we did not have video surveillance. Since that time I have wanted to experiment with cameras and ways of securing homes. Now that I am in college and have the abundance of knowledge and resources I have perused this security camera issue in my senior project. Using wireless cameras, webcam server programs, and microcontrollers I am setting up a home security surveillance system. This system can be set up easily with some time and not much money at all. My solution is to build a working microcontroller which will drive a stepper motor. This stepper motor will turn a wireless 2.4GHZ camera which will send a signal to a computer acting as a streaming media server. The server will broadcast the signal to the internet so an individual can access the camera and see what is happening at their home or where ever the camera is mounted.",

One or two cashiers waiting on customers one at a time and usually not in any hurry to do so. Now lets look at department stores and grocery stores. They have lines just as the movie theaters, but to solve some of the problem they introduced self-checkouts. These self-checkouts allow customers to ring up their own purchases and bag them, while one cashier watches over four or more terminals. Now take this same technology and apply it to the theater scenario. Now one cashier can monitor multiple customers at one time making movie lines a thing of the past. This paper goes over how the technology could be implemented into the theater scenario and also how it could add features such as movie previews for the customer. It goes over how to use software like Visual Basic to create the programs and how to network them together.",

There are several types of computer cluster structures, each suited to a specific kind of operation. There are also many different types, brands, and distributions of clustering software available, both commercially and through the GNU public license. One such software distribution is a Linux-based package called openMosix, and it is used through the ClusterKnoppix version of Linux to construct a very small cluster for demonstration purposes here. It is built by booting several computers on an established LAN with the ClusterKnoppix CD. The cluster sets itself up with almost no user maintenance as the members boot, works efficiently to distribute a test load sequence activated on one of the nodes, then is torn down simply by removing the CD from which ClusterKnoppix boots, demonstrating the speed, simplicity, and non-invasiveness of the ClusterKnoppix implementation of openMosix.",

        "projectDesc": "Releasing the lock mechanism on a basic home door lock requires a significant amount of force against the lock latch itself in order to push it open. Also, for maximum security this mechanism should also automatically lock the door back after a few seconds that allow for entry time. Doing so involves the use of a stepper motor connected to a programmable drives board with a basic stamp microcontroller. The basic stamp microcontroller can be programmed to turn the stepper motor clockwise for a set amount of turns and then to turn the microcontroller back counterclockwise the same amount of turns after a brief pause in between. A screw, or another rod-like object that will fit into the groves of the stepper motor, will be used to push out from the door frame when the stepper motor turns clockwise, thus unlocking the door, and then pull back into the frame when the motor runs counterclockwise, locking the door back. The stepper motor will be mounted on the door frame (not the door), a few inches back from where the latch hole is. This entire circuit is powered by an X10 appliance module connected to a car cord adapter (which drops the voltage of the power supply to 6V). This enables the system to be hookup up to a home PC via X10 and accessed remotely over the internet.",

Another benefit is having the lights ready to be turned on by a remote or motion sensor when you arrive in the dark and do not have to be hooking up batteries that you have hauled to the cabin. This project is a solution to the problem that was developed though many hours of research, design and trouble shooting using a microcontroller and Powerline Technology to control the two light circuits.",

Home businesses seem to be on the rise for those who don’t receive the salary they deserve or those who just want more money. That’s understandable, right? Of course. While working their regular 9-5 job hours when do they have time to take care of the most important things at their business at home. How will they know if a package arrives during the day or whether a customer stops by wanting information about a product or even wanting to purchase or pick up a purchased? Well one thing is for sure, they can’t while at work. I have an alternative to this problem while working a 9-5 job and its all in one package to fit your needs, X10. X10 products will enable you to view and control cameras, lamps, appliances, T.V.’s, etc from any remote location. While your at work you can indeed know when, what time, and who arrived at your house on a given day, while your at work. This solution comes in three small software downloads from X10.",
