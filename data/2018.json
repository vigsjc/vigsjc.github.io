Security cameras can be expensive but with Raspberry pi's it can be a cheap and fun setup to create. This system allows you to monitor anywhere you would like by simply accessing the IP address of each Raspberry Pi. It includes motion activation and night vision so that you do not use up all your hard drive space recording nothing and so that the cameras can see at night. Each camera is fully customizable once logged into the secure website via the IP addresses from each Pi.",

My primary purpose for this project was to create a circuit that could be used to test the indicated voltage and current values of a device and be able to easily read this information in a variety of ways and be able to understand the various properties of a devices voltage and current draw. The secondary purpose was to expand my understanding of Arduino programming and to learn how to properly communicate with online services like Google without requiring human input (hitting keys on a keyboard or mouse). For the draft version of this the results for the first core have met my expectations and have allowed me a way to properly read a load's voltage and current as well as take the data and create graphs in Microsoft Excel pulled from a SD card.",

For this reason, a simple retro gaming station was selected, made from a Raspberry Pi micro-computer, running the Retro Pie OS. Though it was assumed at the time that setting up a new OS would be simple regardless of previous experience, it was also chosen to add in bits to the project that could suit a given users personal taste, as well as improved the overall quality of the product being created. This involved a fair mixture of computing, electronic, and coding knowledge. It should be noted here that despite the lack of any real action outside of the removal of ROM hosting sites by Nintendo and other copyright owners, the downloading of ROM files is currently considered a legal grey area, and that the only safe, legal way to acquire them is by making your own backups. All specificities can be found, covered by Justin Pot in \"Is Downloading Retro Video Game ROMs Ever Legal?\"",

There is one main unit that houses the power supplies and the speaker for the unit, that unit then breaks out to a control board that can support up to two more feeders.

A good amount of my time was spent look and searching information on how (RF) waves travel as well as trouble shooting trying to figure out how device can differentiate between calls and texts. The results proved to be quite promising the LED would go off when a mobile device in range would receive a text message of a phone call.

This will allow connected devices to make decisions based on the data that they gather. Devices will automate many tasks that are considered chores today. Users of the Internet of Things will be able to will things to happen through seamless interactions with their devices. An implementation of such a network will require further advancement in computer technology and security but will provide a new type of intuitive experience that has never been seen before. This begins to seem like a daunting task, but it may be more familiar than one may think. Although advancement is required, it will use the existing Internet architecture and many existing technologies to form a functional device network. My goal for this project is to create a simple IoT automatic notification system that utilizes sensors to notify the user of environment conditions.

With the introduction of gaming consoles in the late 90â€™s arcades began to lose popularity and by the 2000 became nearly extinct. The purpose of this project is to create a portable arcade stick and emulate retro games using the raspberry pie along the retro-pie operating system. With this project I will attempt to make a game system that can introduce to new generations to the arcade systems. The phase one of the project is to set up the raspberry pi to emulate old games and act as base for the game system. Phase two implements an arcade stick to the game system.",

I had experience working with Raspberry Pi's and my existing knowledge in JavaScript helped write the code that would be necessary to control the moving parts. I mainly focused on researching ways to my coffee pot small enough to replace an existing coffee pot. The automating the amount of water needed for a brew was successful and worked great. The water container was also designed to look ascetically pleasing. I am satisfied with being able to control the water required for a fresh pot of coffee and with the overall look of the project. Being able to remotely control the machine along with its pleasant design is a great accomplishment so far. I plan on designing and implementing a coffee grind dispenser to truly automate the entire coffee brewing process.",
