Through this, we hope to show the versatility of Linux-based systems for applications beyond servers and other more well known uses.",

Many people have not heard of bouldering, and even fewer have heard of installing a bouldering wall in your attic. In order to help my friend capture images of his attic climbing I built a server, installed Windows Server 2003, a wireless NIC, a webcam, and software to detect motion and capture the images while he is climbing. The images are stored to an FTP folder which in turn is backed up over the network to a Linksys storage device. Since space is limited in the attic, only the server and webcam are there. The server is remotely managed by me using real VNC to turn on the webcam or whatever else I may need to do from my desktop downstairs.",

This article will show how to implement household tools into a device that will help the signal of your store bought USB adapter. The use of the wok seemed natural, for it has a perfectly round and cupping shape that is used in antennas all over the world. The round cupping shape will bounce a signal inside the cupping toward the center where the USB adapter will be waiting for the reception.",

A temporary solution was found by buying an RC tank, wireless security camera, and motion sensor alarm. The camera allows for surveillance, and the motion detector provides security from intruders in an area. The tank is for warning and dispersing intruders by nonviolent or violent means. The current version supplies nonviolent means only. This capstone project is based off of a real military technology called an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). Future improvements call for a bigger four foot model with titanium armor, a three hundred sixty degree motion detector, and tear gas or live ammo.",

This project will take an old arcade cabinet and fit it with a PC, along with a monitor, running Xubuntu and MAME. Through this, we hope to show the versatility of Linux-based systems for applications beyond servers and other more well known uses.",

        "projectDesc": "My project was to find an efficient and effective way to implement a computer lab or cybercafe type of environment. In doing this I was to find a way to lower downtime to a minimum and to keep systems in this setup secure. The main problem with this is the amount of traffic that a cybercafe would generate. The amount of users using a specific system would be far greater than an average home or office computer, therefore would need an extra set of security. That is where imaging software (such as Synmatec Ghost Suite and Clonezilla) and security software (such as DeepFreeze and Microsoft SteadyState) come into play. My project will showcase the ease of use and very practical usage of such a setup in any computer environment.",

Administrators could post school news, events, and reminders to staff. Teachers could post classroom information, assignments for students, see upcoming important classroom events. Students would have to ability to retrieve/post assignments, discuss classroom material online with other students, and hopefully have the ability to check grades.",
