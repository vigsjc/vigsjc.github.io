Many people have not heard of bouldering, and even fewer have heard of installing a bouldering wall in your attic. In order to help my friend capture images of his attic climbing I built a server, installed Windows Server 2003, a wireless NIC, a webcam, and software to detect motion and capture the images while he is climbing. The images are stored to an FTP folder which in turn is backed up over the network to a Linksys storage device. Since space is limited in the attic, only the server and webcam are there. The server is remotely managed by me using real VNC to turn on the webcam or whatever else I may need to do from my desktop downstairs.",

This article will show how to implement household tools into a device that will help the signal of your store bought USB adapter. The use of the wok seemed natural, for it has a perfectly round and cupping shape that is used in antennas all over the world. The round cupping shape will bounce a signal inside the cupping toward the center where the USB adapter will be waiting for the reception.",

A temporary solution was found by buying an RC tank, wireless security camera, and motion sensor alarm. The camera allows for surveillance, and the motion detector provides security from intruders in an area. The tank is for warning and dispersing intruders by nonviolent or violent means. The current version supplies nonviolent means only. This capstone project is based off of a real military technology called an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). Future improvements call for a bigger four foot model with titanium armor, a three hundred sixty degree motion detector, and tear gas or live ammo.",

        "projectDesc": "Whether it is for a long distance business meeting, long-distance learning, or communicating with family, video and audio communication have become a crucial part of everyday life in today’s fast-paced world. For my project I set out to research, design and configure a multimedia redistribution system for use in an educational or business environment. Equipment, including personal computers, servers and a portion of the local area network was provided by the Williamsburg Independent School District. I did most of my research physically away from the facility while I studied at Satakunta University of applied sciences in Pori, Finland. Because of this, remote access services had to be set up reliably. I successfully set up the distribution system in the Williamsburg school, allowing live video streams to be accessed internally by students and teachers. Externally archived video can also be accessed via the internet.",

This project will take an old arcade cabinet and fit it with a PC, along with a monitor, running Xubuntu and MAME. Through this, we hope to show the versatility of Linux-based systems for applications beyond servers and other more well known uses.",

In doing this I was to find a way to lower downtime to a minimum and to keep systems in this setup secure. The main problem with this is the amount of traffic that a cybercafe would generate. The amount of users using a specific system would be far greater than an average home or office computer, therefore would need an extra set of security. That is where imaging software (such as Synmatec Ghost Suite and Clonezilla) and security software (such as DeepFreeze and Microsoft SteadyState) come into play. My project will showcase the ease of use and very practical usage of such a setup in any computer environment.",
