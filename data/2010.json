On one front, there are entire corporations built around providing server farms to other organizations as off-site hosting, while on the other side of the coin almost every household with an internet connection has a small network. In today’s ever expanding digital world, the demand for more servers and more logical space is soaring ever higher, while the physical space to house such servers is diminishing and demanding a high premium. A solution to this problem exists in virtualization, even the virtualization of entire server farms onto only a handful, or even a single physical server. I present that multiple logical servers can be established on a single physical server, and that these servers can load balance between themselves while sharing a common physical drive.",

        "projectDesc": "Ethernet is everywhere today and automation manufacturers are racing to see who can come up with the latest, greatest and fastest. And the manufacturing world is scrambling to keep up with the latest developments in Ethernet. However in the cost competitive world of manufacturing, throwing out old, perfectly functioning automation is simply unrealistic for some business owners. But at the same time they recognize that they have to begin to using devices with new technology like Ethernet. The creators of Modbus even recognized this and modified their protocol to be used by Ethernet, calling it Modbus-TCP. But how can businesses bridge the gap between their old serial Modbus devices and the new Modbus-TCP? That’s where the Modbus Gateway comes into play.\n\nA Modbus gateway allows for the seamless transfer of Modbus data between serial and Ethernet Modbus devices. Using the Modbus gateway, my project examines the steps needed to setup Modbus communications between a Modbus serial programmable logic controller (PLC) and a Honeywell temperature controller that uses Modbus-TCP. The PLC, which serves as the Modbus master, has two serial communication ports using RS-232 and a third serial port that uses RS-485. The PLC programming software contains the necessary Modbus instructions for sending (writing) and receiving (reading) data. The Honeywell temperature controller is the Modbus slave and responds to read/write requests from the PLC Modbus master. Limitations imposed by the Honeywell controller included access to only eleven data registers per read instruction and a minimum time delay of two hundred milliseconds between write instructions, which was accomplished with sequential delay timers in the PLC program.\n\nIn addition to reading and writing data between the Modbus devices, the PLC, through the use of its own internal program, needed to be able to control its outputs based on the data it requested from the temperature controller. At the same time the temperature controller maintained its independent control and monitoring of a heat source connected to its output. In my prototype the heat source is a soldering iron and a thermocouple attached to it to provide a temperature feedback to the Honeywell controller.\n\n\n\n\n",
