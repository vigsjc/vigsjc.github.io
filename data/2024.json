Given their inherent security vulnerabilities, separating them from personal devices like phones and laptops is crucial (IBM Technology, 2023). IoT devices such as smart TVs, thermostats, refrigerators, ovens, and network-enabled cameras belong on the dedicated IoT network. By doing so, users can enjoy enhanced security and peace of mind knowing both their personal and IoT devices are better protected.",

    "projectDesc": "The primary technical challenge addressed in this project involves establishing a reliable backup internet service for our main site (ABF). The solution proposed includes the deployment of two airFiber 60 HD wireless bridges, connecting ABF and the secondary site, AFX. These bridges will enable a point-to-point network that serves as a backup ISP connection. At ABF, the bridge will link directly to a WAN port on the existing firewall, which is configured to automatically failover in the event the main WAN connection fails. Conversely, at AFX, the bridge will be connected to the main network switch, integrating the backup link into the broader network infrastructure. This setup not only ensures continuity of internet access at ABF but also leverages existing network capabilities at AFX to provide a seamless failover mechanism.",

While the ability to access your data and your software is sped up compared to the cloud, it does place the risk of losing the data solely on the company. This is why having a backup and recovery solution is detrimental to your business. For years my employer has paid money to an outside source to setup and manage these backup solutions. I wanted to take on the responsibility of setting up a new solution in which we save a substantial amount of money. For this reason, I chose to set up a cloud backup solution and a cheaper local backup solution to ensure we are always protecting the data. I researched and found software called VEEAM that can be used to set up, and manage complete backups of the servers and data we have on them. I paired this with a cloud environment called Wasabi and a local NAS called Synology. These two storage solutions helped simplify and successfully accomplish my new backup and recovery solution.",

This solution arises from the growing number of files I need to be able to access on my network and on computers away from my network. This solution also arises from a desire to keep my information and data secure, avoiding processing and usage by large companies",
