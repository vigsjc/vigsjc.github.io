Given their inherent security vulnerabilities, separating them from personal devices like phones and laptops is crucial (IBM Technology, 2023). IoT devices such as smart TVs, thermostats, refrigerators, ovens, and network-enabled cameras belong on the dedicated IoT network. By doing so, users can enjoy enhanced security and peace of mind knowing both their personal and IoT devices are better protected.",
