This created a scenario where every time the pets needed through the gate my parents had to stand up open the gate. So my solution was to create a RFID operated automatic pet door so they did not have to spend time letting the pets through the gate. This would involve a putting a tag on the pet’s collar that when read by the RFID reader it would sent a output signal to the stepper motor to run the door to let the pet through. Of course this would have to involve some programming and I decided to use Arduino programming since the necessary components were available and the community for support was there for troubleshooting.",

An automated pet door would enable pets to gain some freedom and take care of themselves if they need to go outside to the bathroom or access other parts of the home. This project uses an Arduino Uno microcontroller that controls Infrared (IR) LEDs to sense the presence of a pet, which then signals a motor to raise the door, allowing the pet access outside or inside. It will also feature time-of-day security components as well as a buzzer to indicate that the door is in use. The Arduino can be used as a stand-alone system that can be very beneficial in serving the needs of pets and their owners.",

I believe that these components are necessary in order to have a fully functional server foundation. With these services implemented, I encourage every home user to be creative on what they would want to do with their home server depending on the household size and the frequency of the home computer usage. Also, this will become a positive learning experience for families across the globe and me. My intentions for this project were to save money that most companies would pay for a typical corporate server. The fact of the matter is that server administration, hardware, and software costs can get out of hand immensely and it is important to come up with cost effective technology.",

I have becomre more aware of break-ins in my surrounding apartments and have had my car broken into several times over the past few years. So I have decided to create a DIY home security system for my apartment, to protect my dogs and the valuables I have in my home. The Arduino microcontroller based system is easy to install by yourself and is affordable at roughly $80.",

I really don’t have room to put another hard drive in my computer case, so I came up with a resolution. I will build a stand-alone pc and install a media server on it. This computer will be built for around $500 and will include a strong processor and plenty of storage and room for storage expansion. Since I really don’t have room to put it by the desk, I will install TeamViewer and put the computer in a different location in the house. I will be able to remote in when needed to gain access to the computer. I will start out with a 2 TB hard drive and go expand from there when needed.",

In order for the project to be considered successful it must provide a LAN for several users who want both wired and wireless connections, have network services within the router/firewall, provide for centralized data storage and backup, and also provide for an easy to use and easy to control, affordable home media center. The scope of the project includes using preexisting PC hardware for use in a router setup using the openly available software Smoothwall, desktop switches, a wireless access point for wireless data transfer, parting out a custom PC to build for use as a NAS - capitalizing on the open source FreeNAS software - and using a Raspberry PI as a networked media center device. In this project, the NAS (Network Attached Storage) device can hold many different pieces of data such as document backup, media storage like music, photos, and movies for the Pi, as well as whole disk image backups. In order to control the Pi after initial setup, an iPad should be configured as a remote control.",

Throughout the process of building my website I learned a great many things. First and foremost I learned how to use a program called Wordpress. Wordpress is a piece of software that was created to allow every day users to make and manage blogs. Now the software has evolved to the point that you can make just about any kind of website you’d like. In my educational adventure I used widgets, theme editors, php, css, html, and the GUI to design, tweak, and produce a functional ecommerce website from the ground up. I found that some things I thought to be extremely difficult were made rather easy by this software. On the other hand I also found that some of the simplest of things, like getting pictures to line up correctly, were quite complicated by the nature of the interface.",
