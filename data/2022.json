My goal for this project is to create a chess clock using an Arduino microcontroller that can announce a winner and activate a buzzer when a timer reaches zero. I went through a few different designs but settled on a simple square look with two buttons on top and an LCD screen for the timers. A 30-minute timer is used for both players with the other players timer being activated when the opposing player presses their button to end their turn. Once a timer reaches zero a buzzer goes off and a message displays on the LCD screen saying who won.",
