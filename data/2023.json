In this capstone project, I installed the TrueNAS OS onto old, refurbished hardware to  create an open-source NAS device. Looking back, the project was quite successful considering  that I established connection to the server via Windows user interface, implemented media server functionality, and was able to create/secure remote access outside of the given NAS network.",

To achieve a portable and affordable penetration  test machine, I selected the single-board computer system AML-S905X-CC (Le Potato). Along  with this, the Alfa AWUS036ACS WiFi adapter was selected because the adapter has packet  injection and monitor mode which is essential in conducting a variety of pen tests. With the  combination of a cheap single-board computer and WiFi adapter, penetration tests will become  more easily conducted due to price and portability.",

The game Sonic Adventure 2 was ported to the PC in 2013, but some of its features were stripped out for the port. Specifically, how in the original release players could transfer their Chao, a small creature you could raise as a side part of the game, to a handheld console to let you train your chao on the go and unlock special items. Since the PC has no way to connect to these devices, and even if they did, the save files have changed a lot. I think a better solution would be to make a new game to replace the old Handheld version. As of writing this the project has not been fully realized, due to my own personal failings. It has a basic gameplay experience right now and a basic way of transferring data between SA2 and Tiny Chao Dungeon.",

   "projectDesc": "The purpose of this project is to build a device that could accurately measure distance in feet and inches. I wanted to build a device that could be used by anyone trying to measure anything, from a small DIY project to how high can this drone fly in the air. To achieve this, an Arduino Uno has been used has the microcontroller to supply the code for the device (written in C++), an ultra-sonic sensor has been used to measure distance, an LCD display has been used to display the results of the ultra-sonic sensor, and two LED lights have been used to keep track of the measurements.",
