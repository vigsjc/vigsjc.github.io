   "projectDesc": "The project includes the design and development of a vacuum tube guitar amp. This project is completely hand built and hand wired, including the aluminum amp chassis, circuit board, design/layout of components, and the wood cabinets to enclose the amp and speaker. The amp uses tube rectification, and employs a push-pull (Class AB) power amp section. The design is based on a Fender Deluxe 5E3 model amp circa 1957, but is updated to include modern safety features and functionality. The amp is also designed to allow for post-tube-preamp analog-digital signal conversion for processing in an external laptop computer, followed by digital-analog signal conversion which is then fed into the tube power amp section. The amp has been tested for safety as well as proper operation, tone, and usability. Special attention was given to safety, both in operation as well as in future repair and maintenance, due to the extremely high AC and DC voltages and large capacitors found in such a vacuum tube circuit.",

The problem I have found with these products on the market are there price and functionality. I could not find one that fit what I was looking for and wanted to create my own.To create this project I used a microcomputer, in this case a raspberry pi, and connected it to a servo motor. I designed code that allows for the scheduling of a specified amount of food to be dispensed at the times you set. This is housed in a custom made frame that protects the wires, devices, and motor.",

Using the open source router software Pfsense, the use of intrusion detection and firewall features are available. Also, using Docker containerization the use of multiple applications on a single server is possible. Providing a smart switch with VLAN network segmentation capabilities allows for further control of a network. In developing this project anyone, including businesses, can have a turn-key network in a single case. 3D modeling and printing may be used to easily develop and prototype a single case for an All-In-One Network. In developing this project anyone, including businesses, can have a turn-key network in a single case. Overall, there are several areas in which small business networking could be improved through the effective use of cyber systems.",

The project will be using a Raspberry Pi as the delivery vehicle for the monitoring of network traffic, location of where traffic is originating from and where the traffic is going. The security provided by the Pi can also serve as another layer in the “defense in depth” concept which was laid out in other coursework for this degree. Also, this concept could be scaled up to allow for the monitoring of larger networks or as a company expands into new offices or hardware. Specialized security tools will be used for generating reports which can be used to make an informed decision about what the next steps should be in securing the network and what risks the users need to be aware of. This project could also be used to provide early detection for risks associated with out-of-date software or uninstalled patches to the operating systems on the network that anti-virus or anti-malware products may not yet be updated to detect.",

The system should be able to do everything the main stream rival can do if it is to be considered as a serious competition. So, this device will have the ability to inform about security breaches and also be able to provide real-time surveillance.\\nThe device chosen to accomplish all these functions was a Raspberry Pi, a small linux-based computer. This small PC allows amateurs and even professionals to play with and recreate electronic devices and also learn how to program them.\\nWith the PI, it is also possible to use sensors to detect changes in temperature, humidity, sounds, proximity, control robots, use as a server, and even turn on live streams required for a home security system.",

Staying at the forefront of this ever advancing wave is crucial in adapting to the unique demands imposed upon IT infrastructure both in terms of internal and external forces. One of the most defining advancements for networking devices is that of Software Defined Networking.\\nUnique in the fact that management and control is held by a centralized controller, SDN seeks to alter the traditional IT paradigm. OpenFlow, a recently released network protocol serves as the de facto spearhead to this revolution, having been adopted already in production environments despite its relative infancy.\\n\\nThe Zodiac FX as a device is a prototyping switch that utilized SDN through OpenFlow in order to allow enthusiast and research driven individuals opportunity to experiment and develop applications without more traditional, costly networking equipment.\\nIn exploration of SDN and OpenFlow as a potential source of in-built security, I seek the construction of a simple network prototype consisting of a small handful of host machines utilizing the Zodiac FX.\\n\\nDivided into a multi-phase schedule the project is oriented around a two core methodology with the proposal of a pre-meditated extension; each core representing a standalone state of the project wholly capable of existing within its own right. The first of these cores representing a stable state through which the Zodiac FX is configured and capable of handling closely monitored, or even simulated traffic. The second introducing its role as a security device, most notably as the network’s standing firewall – were previously simulated traffic is brought into a hand tailored network through which this performance may be monitored. The final, optional, extension further expanding upon the network serviced by the device – through the introduction of a second Zodiac FX, and the implementation of a wireless access point.\\nKeywords: OpenFlow, Zodiac FX, Open Source, Network Security",

One has to deal with expenses dependent on amount of storage and the duration of the subscription, as well as issues arising from privacy laws that differ from location to location. But, by having a personal cloud server, one is in control of who has access to the data and where the data is located; and if working from a business standpoint, all important data can be backed up into a secure location completely managed in-house. The issue that arises from this method of storage though is that it has to be able to be built and maintained for a lower cost than a subscription based service and be remotely accessible while retaining security during transmissions. In order to accomplish this the task, I turned to the use of two Raspberry Pis. One Raspberry Pi will act as a cloud server and the other will act as a VPN server. The VPN will encrypt all the data being transmitted to and from the cloud storage server to ensure the security of the data.",
