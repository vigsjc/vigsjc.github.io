      "projectDesc": "The project includes the design and development of a vacuum tube guitar amp. This project is completely hand built and hand wired, including the aluminum amp chassis, circuit board, design/layout of components, and the wood cabinets to enclose the amp and speaker. The amp uses tube rectification, and employs a push-pull (Class AB) power amp section. The design is based on a Fender Deluxe 5E3 model amp circa 1957, but is updated to include modern safety features and functionality. The amp is also designed to allow for post-tube-preamp analog-digital signal conversion for processing in an external laptop computer, followed by digital-analog signal conversion which is then fed into the tube power amp section. The amp has been tested for safety as well as proper operation, tone, and usability. Special attention was given to safety, both in operation as well as in future repair and maintenance, due to the extremely high AC and DC voltages and large capacitors found in such a vacuum tube circuit.",

Using the open source router software Pfsense, the use of intrusion detection and firewall features are available. Also, using Docker containerization the use of multiple applications on a single server is possible. Providing a smart switch with VLAN network segmentation capabilities allows for further control of a network. In developing this project anyone, including businesses, can have a turn-key network in a single case. 3D modeling and printing may be used to easily develop and prototype a single case for an All-In-One Network. In developing this project anyone, including businesses, can have a turn-key network in a single case. Overall, there are several areas in which small business networking could be improved through the effective use of cyber systems.",

A significant amount of time was spent researchingArduino systems along with HVAC usage. I also researched how weather stations used anemometers for wind measurements.I was able to build a functioning device that tracks wind speed and average wind speed in a HVAC system. By using these two measurements I can determine the health of the overall system.",

The project will be using a Raspberry Pi as the delivery vehicle for the monitoring of network traffic, location of where traffic is originating from and where the traffic is going. The security provided by the Pi can also serve as another layer in the “defense in depth” concept which was laid out in other coursework for this degree. Also, this concept could be scaled up to allow for the monitoring of larger networks or as a company expands into new offices or hardware. Specialized security tools will be used for generating reports which can be used to make an informed decision about what the next steps should be in securing the network and what risks the users need to be aware of. This project could also be used to provide early detection for risks associated with out-of-date software or uninstalled patches to the operating systems on the network that anti-virus or anti-malware products may not yet be updated to detect.",

This small PC allows amateurs and even professionals to play with and recreate electronic devices and also learn how to program them.\\nWith the PI, it is also possible to use sensors to detect changes in temperature, humidity, sounds, proximity, control robots, use as a server, and even turn on live streams required for a home security system.",

OpenFlow, a recently released network protocol serves as the de facto spearhead to this revolution, having been adopted already in production environments despite its relative infancy.\\n\\nThe Zodiac FX as a device is a prototyping switch that utilized SDN through OpenFlow in order to allow enthusiast and research driven individuals opportunity to experiment and develop applications without more traditional, costly networking equipment.\\nIn exploration of SDN and OpenFlow as a potential source of in-built security, I seek the construction of a simple network prototype consisting of a small handful of host machines utilizing the Zodiac FX.\\n\\nDivided into a multi-phase schedule the project is oriented around a two core methodology with the proposal of a pre-meditated extension; each core representing a standalone state of the project wholly capable of existing within its own right. The first of these cores representing a stable state through which the Zodiac FX is configured and capable of handling closely monitored, or even simulated traffic. The second introducing its role as a security device, most notably as the network’s standing firewall – were previously simulated traffic is brought into a hand tailored network through which this performance may be monitored. The final, optional, extension further expanding upon the network serviced by the device – through the introduction of a second Zodiac FX, and the implementation of a wireless access point.\\nKeywords: OpenFlow, Zodiac FX, Open Source, Network Security",

The issue that arises from this method of storage though is that it has to be able to be built and maintained for a lower cost than a subscription based service and be remotely accessible while retaining security during transmissions. In order to accomplish this the task, I turned to the use of two Raspberry Pis. One Raspberry Pi will act as a cloud server and the other will act as a VPN server. The VPN will encrypt all the data being transmitted to and from the cloud storage server to ensure the security of the data.",
