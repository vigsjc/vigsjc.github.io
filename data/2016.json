I worked alone towards the completion of the product, although I did receive advice from several colleagues of mine, and where reasonable implemented said advice. All three of the questions were answered in the affirmative, although it took a larger than expected amount of time, effort, and money to reach that point. Upon completion of the project, I wish I had more time in order to improve the functionality and design of the final product beyond its concluding state.",

Within the last few years, wireless IP cameras have become common in the market. They are easier to install due to not having to pull hard-wire network to the camera location; something that can be time-consuming and expensive depending on the location. Even with the convenience of wireless networking technology, there are still constraints to the environments these cameras can be deployed in. One example is an area where the Wifi-signal is weak or completely non-existent due to the distance from the nearest Wireless Access Point, or environments that interfere with or block RF signals. Another potentially limiting factor is the location of the nearest power outlet. The “wireless” component of the wireless cameras system is strictly wireless internet and cameras typically require some wired power to function. My system enhances the deployment range of wireless IP cameras using a combination of an external, disconnect-able antenna that can be installed distances from the IP camera and a solar power battery charging system that uses the Sun’s energy to power the camera and charge the battery during the day and runs off battery power at night.",

My main purpose was to build a pressure sensitive alarm circuit using piezo sensors and incorporate an Arduino device to notify me when Jinx was scratching my furniture. The alarm circuit diagrams were readily available and easy to construct. Learning to write program code for the Arduino was very time consuming and I had to downscale the entire project so I would have a working prototype for the final presentation. I was able to complete the scaled down prototype and I plan to complete this project and improve upon it in the near future.",

I also have gained proficiency in backup, deletion and installation of new Cisco firmware. The main goal to be achieved was to create a secure home office network though the use of a Cisco Catalyst 3550 switch. The use of VLANs, access lists, port security, Secure Shell, DHCP and personal firewall configuration have resulted in a very secure network. Upon the completion of this project I have concluded that the results are pleasing. I was able to confirm the networking of all devices was optimal and rules put in place for security were working as designed.",

This device should even attract the gamers out there that want something that can be more than just a mouse but something that will enhance your gaming experience. It is amazing how we look at something that have already been made by someone else and we start to think, what can we do to not change the main function of the device but upgrade. This is how I feel about the mouse but there is nothing wrong with the basic mouse. When I think about the people that want something perfect for gaming and the people that have certain disabilities, I want this invention to be something that will help these type of people without changing the voltage.",

Time was spent mostly on trial and error to determine the best four zones to cover with the cameras, testing in all weather and lighting conditions, and optimizing the application for remote viewing. Overall, the project turned out very well even though I ended up not implementing my Core II plan due to both the wishes of my parents and legitimate concerns for overall quality of the system.

The basic operation is when the user requests a computer program to be executed, the program will be pulled from the hard drive and then be stored into the system’s RAM.
