I want this to be built around either a Raspberry Pi or an Arduino microcontroller, as they both can support the hardware and software needed to build the engraver. To accomplish this I will need to build the frame, which will have an x and y-axis. The machine will move on threaded rods that are powered by two motors that are controlled by two different motor drivers, which are connected to the microcontroller. The laser will be mounted on the x-axis and is powered by the laser circuit that is also connected to the microcontroller. Once the machine is complete, I will be able to make designs to engrave in a program called Inkscape that is able to convert it into gcode. The gcode file is then sent to the engraver to make a finished product.",

The email that the email sends will have the subject “Arduino Security System” along with one of two messages depending on which one of the two triggers is activated. The first message will read, “The human sensor is active” and will be sent when a PIR sensor sees movement. The second message will read, “The door is open” and will be sent when a magnetic switch, which is placed on a door, is separated. This signal is sent to an Arduino which will telnet to an SMTP server called SMTP2Go, using the telnet commands, the Arduino will tell SMTP2Go to email me at my personal email at gmail.com with one of the two messages mentioned above. The actual triggers will consist of one single pull single throw (SPST) switch, one acting as a master switch to block the emails from accidentally going off, the other is a single pull double throw magnetic switch placed on a door. The last trigger will be a PIR human sensor which will go to a TTL logic AND gate, which will in turn lead to the microcontroller. When this setup is completed, the security system will be able to send an email when activated.",

There is also a high demand for portability and smart applications to control everything. With a mini computer, a few peripherals, a smart phone, and some software applications, this is all possible for under one hundred dollars. This project seeks to address the video on demand trend by integrating a Raspberry Pi into a wireless home network. The Pi is small, portable, and able to output video to any television with an HDMI or component video port. The smart phone, in this case an iPhone, is not only used to control the Raspberry Pi remotely for convenience, but to stream media itself if a few options are added.",

The DVR was created by modifying a desktop computer with a capture card to interface with an incoming TV signal while using Windows Media Center to manage and initiate recordings. After a lot of research on what type of media server to download, Plex was determined to be the best option due to the flexibility, price, and streaming options. In order to manage my server away from home, I chose to install TeamViewer as my remote desktop tool.",
