The solution requires a two-layered security approach: first, the application itself should be protected with a password, and second, each file must require facial recognition authentication before it can be viewed. To achieve this, a Python- based launcher is implemented to prompt for a password before opening the file manager. Files are encrypted using the Fernet encryption module from the cryptography library, and a facial recognition system built with OpenCV and the face_recognition library is used to authenticate users before decrypting and displaying a file. This system enhances security by combining password protection, encryption, and biometric verification.",

There are even cameras that can track motion, whether it's human motion or motion in general. So far in my project, Core 1 and Core 2 have been successful.

Old computers are like time capsules of wonderful progress made in such short periods of time. Though they are easily considered obsolete and exotic in just a few short years, and one may be tempted to dispose of them as has become all too common within our culture, these machines will never be made again and never will be experienced again. If we were to carelessly let them fall the wayside, we would lose some of our most fantastic, albeit historic, achievements as a species. Antique technology, (e.g. Cathode Ray Tubes, Floppy Disks, etc.) deserves to be preserved for future generations to fully understand the history of our manipulation of electrons.My project revolves around taking a dusty thirty-year-old Apple Macintosh LC 575 from the attic of an old school and bringing it back to life again. A variety of ‘Phases’ have been executed in this project, (e.g. Core Phase 1 – ‘Restore Basic Functions’, and Core Phase 2 – ‘Replace & Reinstall’). A large portion of the project, and most of the second ‘Phase’ was to build an alternative device and replace the broken SCSI drive in order that full functionality may be restored. There was also an Extension Phase, (i.e. involving the upgrading of other regular hardware to higher specifications) that ended up in surprise, being a requirement to fully complete Phase 2. I accomplished my goal ultimately, and with my own blood and sweat have not left the silicon to be found wanting. The computer functions fully and is upgraded beyond its original specifications.",

Like most home networks, my home only has a modem, two Wi-Fi routers and a wireless access point, with nothing filtering packets. So, my proposed solution was to install a pfSense router which would filter the traffic between the modem and the Wi-Fi router that gets the internet. As pfSense by itself is just a firewall, I decided to install many of its packages to further the security of my home’s network. Some the packages I plan on installing are Snort, OpenVPN, and pfBlockerNG. Snort is an Intrusion Prevention System, or IPS, and the way I have it set up is that it is monitoring all the traffic that made it past the firewall and blocking in. OpenVPN will give me access to my pfSense router from anywhere, allowing me to reset it if needed or to help troubleshoot a problem that my parents might be having while I’m away. Finally, pfblockerNG is a package that can blacklist IP’s and DNS servers, and an application of this package is that it can be used as a adblocker.",

This project implements a low-cost solution using an Arduino Uno, a soil moisture sensor, and an LCD screen to display data directly. The prototype monitors soil moisture levels, activates an alert (LED or relay for watering) when soil is too dry, and visually reports readings. The project is designed to help users efficiently manage water resources and ensure optimal plant health. Core 1 involved developing the sensor circuit and data acquisition. Core 2 added the LCD interface for user feedback. An optional extension includes relay-controlled irrigation.",

    "projectTitle": "Using Artificial Intelligence to Detect Anomalous Network Connections.",
    "projectDesc": "This project aims to create a system that contains a trained AI model that will detect whether a network connection is normal or anomalous. Current solutions that provide a system like this are aimed at enterprises which leave out small to medium-sized businesses and hobbyists. These current solutions either require propriety hardware to be installed within the network or have a closed-source code that limits the creativity of the user. These solutions also have complex or undisclosed pricing which makes it unobtainable for small companies and hobbyists.\nThe project leverages many open-source software and easily obtainable hardware so it can either be recreated or deployed at various locations. Network connection data will be collected by Zeek, a network analysis software, moved to a central server, and processed by a trained AI model that was trained using the isolation forest model from the PyOD project. The collected connection data along with the AI’s inference on whether it is normal or anomalous will be loaded into an Elasticsearch index. The logs data loaded into this index will be used for visualization with Kibana so a user can see the AI’s decision and other useful information about the connection data.\nThis project is conducted in 3 phases which are divided into 2 cores and an extension. The first core will be to collect preliminary data, process it, and train the AI. The second core will be the consolidation of logs along with the AI’s decision into a database that is easily searchable. The extension will consist of using an open-source data visualization tool to create a single-pane-of-glass display.\nResearch like this has already been done at Arizona State University where a team of researchers trained an AI model using tagged datasets and evaluated how it performed once given a new dataset with known anomalies in it. The testing was successful only if the AI had been previously trained on those attack types.\nOnce the pipeline was fully set up, the system successfully processed the connection logs from start to finish, totaling 43,427 records. About 90 percent were marked as anomalies by the Isolation Forest model, which closely matches the fact that 80 percent of the dataset was synthetic attack traffic. The system produced usable results, even though some false positives were observed due to limited training data.\n",

The utilization of Raspberry Pi would serve as the backbone of this research, with the implementation of a video camera to help capture video footage. The project has three major phases. These include the assembly of the Raspberry Pi itself, the integration of the video camera onto the Raspberry Pi, and, lastly, the deployment of the system.  By using Raspberry Pi to carry out this project, it would serve as not only a scalable option but also an option that is accessible yet cost-effective for any user, regardless of their technological expertise, and capable of performing any form of surveillance when needed.",

    "projectTitle": "Home Intrusion Detection System.",
    "projectDesc": "Home networks are expanding at an exponential rate with a large number of devices being capable of sending and receiving data. Along with this, remote work has increased meaning a large number of people are using their work machines on their home network. These two combined create a large target for cybercriminals due to vast amounts of data that can be stolen. If a home network is compromised, cybercriminals could gain personal information such as banking information, usernames passwords etc. As for remote workers, cybercriminals could gain sensitive information related to work along with work usernames and passwords which could lead them to commit another attack.To counteract this growing risk, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be used to monitor a home network and detect any potential malicious traffic. To do this, and to view the data effectively, Suricata can run alongside Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Fluent bit. Suricata, an open-source detection engine, acts as an Intrusion Detection System. Fluent bit is responsible for logging data from Suricata so that it can be stored and used. Elasticsearch and Kibana are responsible for creating a search engine to view data from Fluent Bit and for creating a visualization of that data to give better insight into the data. While all of these software’s are good on their own, this combination will allow for a highly customizable yet cost-effective solution that will allow for data to be visualized and stored so that any and all traffic can be analyzed effectively versus using each software independently of one another. To install all of these software’s, an old PC can be used with a Linux based operating system installed, in this case Linux Mint and an old monitor. Using an old PC and monitor allows for maximum cost savings. If potentially bad traffic is flagged, the user can view information relating to it and decide on whether to act on it or not..",
