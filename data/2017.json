I have spent quite a bit of time researching and refreshing my programming, networking, and electricity & electronics skills for this project. Throughout the duration of this project, I have found myself reminding myself of all of the skills that I have learned throughout my college career, and being able to create something tangible with those skills has inspired me to push myself until completion of the project. The end results of the project have been very satisfactory for me and have re-ignited the desire to invent and create using the technology we have around us every day.",

      "projectDesc": "The purpose of the project was to implement a home lab environment for testing and furthering the understanding of network devices and computer systems. As a technician, there will be times where new equipment is brought in and will need to be tested. Most technology work environments will supply a lab for doing this but you generally will have to share that space with other employees that could potentially mess up configuration or cause unexpected issues. Having a lab at home that you can work with is great for overcoming this. This project also aimed at accomplishing the task at hand on a college student's budget. The project was broken up into four different phases which include: the Building phase, Core 1, Core 2, and the Presentation phase. Before beginning a project, research is required to get an understanding of what is needed and how much the build will cost. Core 1 was the networking phase in which the router, switch, and hosts were setup and tested. Core 2 covered the setup of the server and the ability to communicate with a host. The final phase, presentation, covered concluding, documenting, and creating a visual representation of the project as a whole. Upon completing this project, I was able to reflect on the tasks that were accomplished and the skills that were needed to complete it. Technical skills/knowledge such as hardware or software configuration, networking, and computer systems were essential but personal/professional skills were needed as well. Professional skills such as time management, stress management, and organization were very important to the completion of the project.",

Most days companies use cloud printing, this can be good except that you don't know who is taking care of your things. My solution is to help people create servers so that they can have someone on site that will manage their information.",

The purpose of my project was to aid individuals in the state of Florida in obtaining fresh produce, seafood, and other food products from their local state; without relying heavily on foreign food sources. Most of the time I spent on the project was trying to understand what the different folders within a tree in the project's directory structure were supposed to do (their overall purpose and what code goes in the directory), along with what different strings of code's functionality (such as posting data or running a server instance) were being implemented into my project. In the end, I constructed a login page with validation along with a simple chat application that I plan to implement in various areas of my application in the near future.",

This device also has the ability to monitor your pet's activity through a network camera that can be accessed through a mobile device. The main reason for building this device was to make it easier on pet owners that might be gone for long hours of the day that need assurance that their friend at home is being taken care of. The final product of the pet feeder worked as expected, but only through a local network connection as of now. I think that the overall project was a success for the intended use.",

My primary purpose of this project was to create a media server by which content that I already owned could be placed, in digital form, onto a network share and then streamed within my household on various devices. The secondary purpose was to create a system of services which would not only acquire items which were requested, but be intuitive enough to gather future episodes or shows without user input and make them readily available on the server. The results of this project met and potentially exceed my expectations because I created a working media server which is not only accessible in my home, but also anywhere with access to the internet allowing me to stream my media outside of my home on my devices.",
