More and more people are switching to online downloads to purchase and rent movies and music. However the switch to digital comes at a cost. Users start to rely on their computers more to store media files. Problems occur when users run out of storage space on their hard drives or the computer’s hardware fails. One solution to the issues faces by home users is to incorporate a server into the home network. An entire family’s life can be placed on the server where it can be accessed from any computer on the network. Windows Home Server and FreeNAS are just two of the many options for creating a server. They both offer easy to use interfaces that can be managed by a typical user. The server can also use RAID as a means of adding fault tolerance to prevent data loss in the event of a hardware failure. Using a home server can allow a family to store files and media in a central location and using RAID can help prevent loss of that data in the event of a failure.",

Each user has a quota on server-side storage, and file screening is used to prevent certain file types from being allowed, such as .exe files. ISA Server was also originally going to be used, but it turned out not to be compatible with Server 2008. Four surveillance cameras are installed inside my home, two of which are infrared for night vision and two that are normal dome color cameras. They connect to a PC using BNC cables and a PCI card. The software that is used to manage the cameras is from EZWatch Pro. From the management console of this software, the cameras are configured to record at all times and detect motion. When motion is detected, an e-mail is sent to me informing me of the motion detected along with pictures of the room at that time. If I choose, a phone call can be made to whoever I want to inform them of the motion detected as well. In the near future, I will be adding biometrics to be used with Active Directory for network authentication, and for entry into my home via Active Directory. Four more infrared cameras will be installed outside of my home, and the two indoor dome color cameras will be replaced with infrared cameras as well.",

        "projectDesc": "School lunch programs are over-budgeted and mired in red ink. Cafeteria lines are inherently inefficient; many cafeteria workers, such as the cashiers, perform tasks that can be automated. Students are forced to wait 10-15 minutes in the cafeteria line and then gulp down their food. Other problems such as students paying with physical currencies can be solved by implementing an automatic debit transfer system. Also, parents are left out of the loop when it comes to the knowledge of what their children eat in the cafeteria at school. What if one program could combine all these tasks into one simple interface that even a child can operate? The “Automated LunchLady” is the answer. The “Automated LunchLady” authenticates the ID of the student through the use of a biometric fingerprint scanner. It then uses a straightforward graphical user interface to allow students to select their food. Lastly, it automates the transfer of funds from the students debit account, eliminating the need for physical currency, and sends and email stating the contents of the child’s food selections to the child’s parents at the same time. This is a simple solution to a complex problem in many overcrowded school cafeterias.",
